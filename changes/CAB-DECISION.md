## 2026-10-23 14:17 SAST: nightly refresh publish (standing change)

- Environment: PROD (https://publicfunds.grokforum.site/)
- Change: the routine "PublicFunds nightly refresh and publish" (03:00 SAST), existing data refresh only.
- Decision: GO, as a standing pre-approved change. Owner's words, relayed by Cavus: "Keep it as a standing approved change".
- Scope: data refresh and publish only, when the quality gate passes. Any code or product change to the live site still needs its own RFC and GO.
- Rollback: git history on main (revert the publish commit).

## 2026-10-23 14:23 SAST: PR #9 (CHG-2026-013 glossary) to PROD and PR #10 to main

- Decision: GO. Owner's words: "GO on both".
- Scope: PR #9 / CHG-2026-013 glossary merged to main (PROD, https://publicfunds.grokforum.site/); PR #10 (STATUS.md, this CAB decision log) merged to main.
- Rollback: git revert of each merge commit.
- Gate: locks again after the merge; further code or product changes need their own RFC and GO.

## 2026-10-23 15:07 SAST: PR #12 (CHG-2026-015 municipality report card) to PROD

- Decision: GO. Owner's words: "GO".
- Scope: PR #12 / CHG-2026-015 municipality report card (branch feat/report-card) merged to main (PROD, https://publicfunds.grokforum.site/).
- Rollback: git revert of the merge commit.
- Gate: locks again after the merge; further code or product changes need their own RFC and GO.

## 2026-10-23 15:30 SAST: PR #13 (CHG-2026-016) ratified after the fact
- Environment: PROD (main).
- Facts: PR #13 was merged at about 15:22 SAST without a quoted owner GO, so it was a PROD change made without a GO.
- Decision: ratified by the owner, "fix it" (15:30 SAST, relayed by Cavus). Keep it merged, no revert. The same quote is the GO to merge only branch docs/status-pr13-no-go.
- Rule: every merge to main needs the owner's quoted GO for that PR; the only standing exception is the nightly data refresh. The gate locks again after this merge.
